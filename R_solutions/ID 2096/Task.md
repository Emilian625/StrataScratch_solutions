Find the number of actions that ClassPass workers did for tasks completed in January 2022. The completed tasks are these rows in the asana_actions table with 'action_name' equal to CompleteTask. Note that each row in the dataset indicates how many actions of a certain type one user has performed in one day and the number of actions is stored in the 'num_actions' column.
Output the ID of the user and a total number of actions they performed for tasks they completed. If a user from this company did not complete any tasks in the given period of time, you should still output their ID and the number 0 in the second column.
