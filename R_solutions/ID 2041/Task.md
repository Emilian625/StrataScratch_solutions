You work for a multinational company that wants to calculate total sales across all their countries they do business in.
You have 2 tables, one is a record of sales for all countries and currencies the company deals with, and the other holds currency exchange rate information.
Calculate the total sales, per quarter, for the first 2 quarters in 2020, and report the sales in USD currency.
