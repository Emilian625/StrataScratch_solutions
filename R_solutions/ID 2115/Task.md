The company for which you work is reviewing its 2021 monthly sales.

For each month of 2021, calculate what percentage of restaurants have reached at least 100$ or more in monthly sales.

Note: Please remember that if an order has a blank value for actual_delivery_time, it has been canceled and therefore does not count towards monthly sales.
