For each guest reviewer, find the nationality of the reviewer’s favorite host based on the guest’s highest review score given to a host. Output the user ID of the guest along with their favorite host’s nationality. In case there is more than one favorite host from the same country, list that country only once (remove duplicates).

Both the from_user and to_user columns are user IDs.
