Given a single column of numbers, consider all possible permutations of two numbers assuming that pairs of numbers (x,y) and (y,x) are two different permutations. 
Then, for each permutation, find the maximum of the two numbers.
Output three columns: the first number, the second number and the maximum of the two.
