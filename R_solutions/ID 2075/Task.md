Given the homework results of a group of students, calculate the average grade and the completion rate of each student. 
A homework is considered not completed if no grade has been assigned.
Output first name of a student, their average grade, and completion rate in percentages. 
Note that it's possible for several students to have the same first name but their results should still be shown separately.
