Following a recent advertising campaign, you have been asked to compare the sales of consumable products across all brands.

Compare the brands by finding the percentage of unique customers (among all customers in the dataset) who purchased consumable products from each brand.

Your output should contain the brand_name and percentage_of_customers rounded to the nearest whole number and ordered in descending order.
