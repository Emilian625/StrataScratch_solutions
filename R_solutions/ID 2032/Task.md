Write a query that returns a table containing the number of signups for each weekday and for each billing cycle frequency.
Output the weekday number (e.g., 1, 2, 3) as rows in your table and the billing cycle frequency (e.g., annual, monthly, quarterly) as columns. 
If there are NULLs in the output replace them with zeroes.
