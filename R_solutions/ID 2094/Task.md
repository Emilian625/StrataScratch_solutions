Each day, you have been asked to find a merchant who earned more money the previous day.

Before comparing totals between merchants, round the total amounts to the nearest 2 decimals places.

Your output should include the date in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD' and the merchant's name, but only for days where data from the previous day is available.

Note: In the case of multiple merchants having the same highest shared amount, your output should include all the names in different rows.
