The company you work for is looking at their delivery drivers' first-ever delivery with the company.

You have been tasked with finding what percentage of drivers' first-ever completed orders have a rating of 0.

Note: Please remember that if an order has a blank value for actual_delivery_time, it has been canceled and therefore does not count as a completed delivery.
