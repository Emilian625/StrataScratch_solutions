There are two tables with user activities. The google_gmail_emails table contains information about emails being sent to users. 
Each row in that table represents a message with a unique identifier in the id field. 
The google_fit_location table contains user activity logs from the Google Fit app.
Find the correlation between the number of emails received and the total exercise per day. 
The total exercise per day is calculated by counting the number of user sessions per day.
