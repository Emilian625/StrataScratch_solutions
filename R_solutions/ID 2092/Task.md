You have been asked to find the top 3 merchants for each day with the highest number of orders on that day.

In the event of a tie, multiple merchants may share the same spot, but each day at least one merchant must be in first, second, and third place.

Your output should include the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD, the name of the merchant, and their place in the daily ranking.
