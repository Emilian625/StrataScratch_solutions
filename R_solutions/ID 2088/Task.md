A movie theater gave you two tables: seats that are available for an upcoming screening and neighboring seats for each seat listed. 
You are asked to find all pairs of seats that are both adjacent and available.
Output only distinct pairs of seats in two columns such that the seat with the lower number is always in the first column and the one with the higher number is in the second column.
