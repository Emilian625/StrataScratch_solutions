The company you work with wants to find out what merchants are most popular for new customers.

You have been asked to find how many orders and first-time orders each merchant has had.

First-time orders are meant from the perspective of a customer, and are the first order that a customer ever made. In order words, for how many customers was this the first-ever merchant they ordered with?

Note: Recently, new restaurants have been registered on the system; however, because they may not have received any orders yet, your answer should exclude restaurants that have not received any orders.

Your output should contain the name of the merchant, the total number of their orders, and the number of these orders that were first-time orders.
