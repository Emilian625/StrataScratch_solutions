A group of travelers embark on world tours starting with their home cities. Each traveler has an undecided itinerary that evolves over the course of the tour. Some travelers decide to abruptly end their journey mid-travel and live in their last destination.
Given the dataset of dates on which they travelled between different pairs of cities, can you find out how many travellers ended back in their home city? For simplicity, you can assume that each traveler made at most one trip between two cities in a day.
