It's time to find out who is the top employee. 
You've been tasked with finding the employee (or employees, in the case of a tie) who have received the most votes.

A vote is recorded when a customer leaves their 10-digit phone number in the free text customer_response column of their sign up response (occurrence of any number sequence with exactly 10 digits is considered as a phone number)

Output the top employee and the number of customer responses that left a number.
